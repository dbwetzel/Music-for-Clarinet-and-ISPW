SCM - SIM Compatibility ModePlace this file in your max folder at the same level as the Max application if you want to use MSP with SCM - the FTS compatibility mode.  This mode restricts many of the most convenient features of MSPso it functions just like the antiquated Max0.26 on the NeXT. Doesn't that sound like fun?For more information please refer to the ISPW Compatibility Lib manual.
