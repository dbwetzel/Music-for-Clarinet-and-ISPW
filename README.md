# Music-for-Clarinet-and-ISPW
This is a working set of Max patches based on Cort Lippe's 2004 Max/MSP port of "Music for Clarinet and ISPW" (1992). 
The purpose of this project is to analyze and reconstruct Lippe's system using a modular approach that fully separates the instrument from the score
A new modular mockup of the system is included as a working model of the piece. This is for testing and study purposes and is not intended at a performance interface
You will need Max 7 (from Cycling 74) to open these documents.
